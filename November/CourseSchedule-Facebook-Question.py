// PROBLEM STATEMENT:
//
// Given a set of tasks, write a function to calculate the total time needed for a particular task to complete.
// The total time means the time of the task plus the time of its dependencies.

// ID time dependencies
// 1  20   [2, 3]
// 2  10   [4]
// 3  5    []
// 4  5    []
//
// Example: If we take Task with id 1:
// task 1 = 20 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 40
// ========================== END OF PROBLEM STATEMENT ==========================

// Below is MY Solution using BFS, initially I propsed Topological Sort (Wrong), I tried to write a DFS solution, but
// the interviewer said an Iterative solution was a good option.
//
// The structure above is clearly a Graph, and the easier way to solve the problem iteratively and within
// a 10 minutes time frame is using BFS! (I think!)
